# Skillmaster

## Summary

This is React Native app (currently for iOS only) that communicates with the Skillmaster API.

## Getting Started

You'll need to make sure you have XCode and npm installed on your machine to get started. Follow the instructions [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
to get React Native installed and working. Clone this repo and navigate to the Skillmaster directory. Run `react-native start` and `react-native run-ios`.
An XCode simulator window should open, as well as a browser debugger.

## Other dependencies

This app uses Redux for state management and [react-native-style-tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/react-native-style-tachyons) for styling.
